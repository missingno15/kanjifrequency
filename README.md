# KanjiFrequency

Crawler written in Elixir designed to crawl Japanese websites in order to create a histogram of the most commonly used Kanji characters on the internet.

To run, just `cd` into the root directory and run `iex -S mix`. By doing so you'll have access to `KanjiFrequency.Histogram.view/0` which will report back the histogram results.
